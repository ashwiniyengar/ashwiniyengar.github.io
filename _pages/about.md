Hi! My name is Ashwin and I am the 2024-2025 [American Mathematical Society Congressional Fellow](https://www.ams.org/government/government/ams-congressional-fellowship), working for the [U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee](https://www.help.senate.gov/ranking/about) on health care policy for Senator Bernie Sanders. I work on a broad range of issues across the committee, but primarily focus on prescription drug pricing and regulation.

Previously, I was a J.J. Sylvester Assistant Professor (3 year postdoc) in the [Johns Hopkins University mathematics department](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/). Before that I was a Ph.D student at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/mathematics) and the [London School of Geometry and Number Theory](http://www.lsgnt-cdt.ac.uk) supervised by [James Newton](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/newton) and [Toby Gee](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~tsg/), a master's student at [Paris Nord](https://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/laga/index.php/fr/laboratoire), and an undergraduate at [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu).

I also volunteer as a scientist at the [Baltimore Underground Science Space (BUGSS)](http://bugssonline.org), where I conduct research for the [Open Insulin Foundation](https://openinsulin.org).
