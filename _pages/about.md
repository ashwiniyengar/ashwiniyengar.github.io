My name is Ashwin and I am a J. J. Sylvester Assistant Professor (3 year postdoc) in the Johns Hopkins University mathematics department, working on number theory and the Langlands program. I am currently applying for jobs for Fall 2024.

Previously, I was a Ph.D student at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/mathematics) and the [London School of Geometry and Number Theory](http://www.lsgnt-cdt.ac.uk) supervised by [James Newton](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/newton) and [Toby Gee](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~tsg/), a master's student at [Paris Nord](https://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/laga/index.php/fr/laboratoire), and before that I was an undergraduate at [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu).

I strongly believe in [Federico Ardila-Mantilla's](https://fardila.com/) axioms:

- **Axiom 1:** Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
- **Axiom 2:** Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
- **Axiom 3:** Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
- **Axiom 4:** Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
