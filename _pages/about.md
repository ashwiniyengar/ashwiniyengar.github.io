Hi! My name is Ashwin and I am the 2024-2025 [American Mathematical Society Congressional Fellow](https://www.ams.org/government/government/ams-congressional-fellowship). From September 2024 to August 2025 I am working on the United States Senate on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee for Bernie Sanders.

Previously, I was a J.J. Sylvester Assistant Professor (3 year postdoc) in the [Johns Hopkins University mathematics department](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/). Before that I was a Ph.D student at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/mathematics) and the [London School of Geometry and Number Theory](http://www.lsgnt-cdt.ac.uk) supervised by [James Newton](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/newton) and [Toby Gee](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~tsg/), a master's student at [Paris Nord](https://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/laga/index.php/fr/laboratoire), and an undergraduate at [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu).

I am also a volunteer scientist at the [Baltimore Underground Science Space (BUGSS)](http://bugssonline.org), where I conduct research for the [Open Insulin Foundation](https://openinsulin.org). I spend my time in the lab trying to make insulin, and thinking about federal regulations around pharmaceutical drug pricing. The Open Insulin Foundation aims to make open-source formulations for insulin, with the ultimate goal of making it more accessible and affordable.

I strongly believe in [Federico Ardila's](https://fardila.com/) axioms:

- **Axiom 1:** Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
- **Axiom 2:** Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
- **Axiom 3:** Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
- **Axiom 4:** Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
