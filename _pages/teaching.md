## London Maths Outreach

In Spring 2020, I co-taught a [London Maths Outreach](https://www.londonmaths.org/) course entitled "Mathematical Aspects of Computer Science" with [Kristina Kubiliūtė](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/kristina-kubili%C5%ABt%C4%97-86a94697). The course was basically an introduction to circuits and specifically logic gates with an eye towards computation.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course was released online weekly in a series of YouTube videos on the London Maths Outreach channel. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzmwKdSpxg2CebgArvieD6W8gAca8b1Bd) is a link to the course: a sample video is included below.

Arushi watched the videos and won a [STEM home challenge](https://www.bmt.org/news/2020/announcing-winner-stem-home-challenge/)!
